            The GSAT (Geostationary Satellite) series is a group of Indian communications satellites developed and launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). These satellites are designed for various applications, such as telecommunication, television broadcasting, broadband, navigation, and data transfer . <br>â€¢GSAT satellites are placed in geostationary orbit, approximately 36,000 km above the equator.<br>
            * They are designed to remain fixed relative to a specific region on Earth, enabling continuous coverage for their designated service areas.<br>
            * Equipped with transponders (devices that relay communication signals), they receive and retransmit signals between ground stations for communication and broadcasting.

        * Strengthens India's self-reliance in communication technology.<br>
        * Reduces dependence on foreign satellite services.<br>
        * Supports India's military, navigation, and emergency communication needs.

                    The Mangalyaan satellite, also known as the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), is India's first interplanetary mission. Here are the key details about this incredible spacecraft:<br>
Launch Details:

The Mangalyaan satellite was launched on November 5, 2013, at 09:08 UTC from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India 1.<br>
Function and Objectives:
The primary objective of the Mangalyaan satellite is to develop the technologies required for designing, planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission. The secondary objective is to explore Mars' surface features, morphology, mineralogy, and Martian atmosphere using indigenous scientific instruments 1.

                    Aryabhata was India's first artificial satellite, named after the famous Indian astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata (476 CE). It was launched on April 19, 1975, from the Soviet Union's Kapustin Yar launch site using a Cosmos-3M rocket.



                    Aryabhata was designed and built by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to conduct scientific experiments in space. The satellite's primary objectives were:<br>
                    1. To test the launch vehicle and satellite system: Aryabhata was used to test the compatibility of Indian satellites with Soviet launch vehicles.<br>
                    2. To conduct scientific experiments: The satellite carried three scientific instruments:<br>
                    * Solar X-Ray Spectrometer: To study the solar X-ray spectrum.<br>
                    * Gamma-Ray Detector: To detect and measure gamma-ray radiation.<br>
                    * Radiation Monitor: To measure the radiation environment in space.

                    Launch Date: April :19,1975.<br>
Planned Mission Duration:5 days.<br>
Actual Mission Duration:17 days (April 19,1975 -May 6, 1975).<br>
Deadline: The satellite's mission was intended to last for 5 days, but it continued to function for 17 days before its power sources were depleted.<br>
Lifespan: Although the satellite's mission was completed on May 6, 1975, it remained in orbit around the Earth for several years. The satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated on February 11, 1992.
